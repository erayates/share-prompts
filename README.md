# Share Prompt

Share Prompt is an open-source AI prompting tool for modern world to
discover, create and share creative prompts.

( This project is a clone project to learn Next.js clearly. Thanks for 
JavaScript Mastery for this project. )

## Demo

## Notes
### Benefits of Next.js
* Next.js simplifies the development process.
* On top of that it optimizes your web apps.

Primary distinction between React.js and Next.js is rendering.
* React renders UI (User Interface) on the Client Side while Next.js performs Server Side Rendering (SSR).

However, Next.js offers flexibility in rendering options. You can choose the render the UI on the Client Side or Server Side according to your needs.


### Client Side Rendering (CSR)
CSR happens on the client's device or the browser. When a user request to a web page, the server sends a basic HTML document and Javascript code. The browser then downloads and executes the Javascript code which leads to the rendering of components and finally display of the Website.

### Server Side Rendering (SSR)
SSR involves rendering the web pages on the server before transmitting it to the client's device. When a user request to a web page, the server processes the req. and renders the components on the server side. The server then sends back the fully rendered HTML to the client's browser enabling immediate display.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
